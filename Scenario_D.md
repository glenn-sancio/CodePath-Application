# Scenario 4

Hi **Dennis**,

Hope you are doing well.

We received your fellow application 3 weeks ago, and I would like to personally congratulate you on completing the application requirements for a tech fellow position, we are excited to have you on board at our organization and its program courses.

Apologies if you haven't heard from us for a while, rest assured that your application is intact, we would like to inform you that before we can admit tech fellows into the tech fellow training, there has to be at least one more eligible Tech Fellow from the same school who completed their requirements as well. This means that we would have to wait for another applicant who completed the application requirements.

To provide you with better support and communication, I will be sending you a weekly update regarding the process of your tech fellow training.

Regards,

Glenn Sancio
On behalf of Codepath.org
