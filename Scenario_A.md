# Scenario 1
Hi **John**,

Thanks for reaching out, and congratulations on your successful application in our program.

We received your request to be put on the Advanced track of our program offering.

To give you an idea of our program tracks, below are the overview links of each course. The first few topics are similar but the pacing of the track depends greatly on the level of the course.

* [Beginner Track](https://www.courses.codepath.org/snippets/advanced_software_eng/overview)
* [Intermediate Track](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/intermediate_software_eng/overview)
* [Advanced Track](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/advanced_software_eng/overview)

Based on your pre-work assessment, it is recommended to place you on the Beginner Track, we would want you to have the best experience possible.

If this doesn’t work or you have more questions, just let me know, and I’ll be happy to help!

Thank you

All the best,
CodePath Team
